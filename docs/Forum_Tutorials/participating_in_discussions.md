#### Replying to Posts by Email

- When someone replies to a post you're following, a **notification email** will be sent to you.
- You can simply **reply to the email directly**. After a few minutes, your response will be automatically posted in the Discourse thread.

 **Tip:**

- You can type `@` followed by a username to notify someone (e.g., `@username`).
- You can **attach files or images** to your email reply. These will be uploaded to the thread with your response.
- Basic formatting (like **bold** or *italic*) may be preserved, depending on your email client.
