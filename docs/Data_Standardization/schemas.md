## Standardizing a data schema
Data schemas, whether they capture the syntactic and semantic details of a single data table, or cover many interlocked tables or transformations between them, are a fertile ground for standardization opportunities.  First we work through a description and recommendations on the mixture of language currently present in describing data schema content, and then discuss how structured vocabularies, including ontologies, can be layered on to help determine semantic comparability.

### Values
A form field, record field, table row field, spreadsheet cell, computational object/class attribute or property or slot, or variable can hold a **value** (aka data item or datum).

### Fundamental datatypes
Crucial to machine readability, a value can be of a certain fundamental "literal" or syntactic **datatype**, like a string, date, time, integer or decimal number, boolean, categorical value or URL reference type.  A few common standard "data-interchange languages" exist that express these: [XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#built-in-datatypes), [JSON](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type) and [SQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sql-data-types). 
  * **Units**: Numeric values may be accompanied by units (e.g. "1m" for a meter, or "2d" for 2 days).  Whether a unit is bundled with a number as a single string datatype value, or whether it is stored separately from a value is a matter for the schema developers to settle. By themselves, units need a string or coding representation, such as provided by [UCUM codes](https://units-of-measurement.org/) or an ontology of units (e.g. [QUDT](http://qudt.org/), [OM](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/), [UO](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/uo)).
  * **String syntax**: A data schema can also provide more complex string data type extensions by imposing further constraints on their syntax in order to express for example the [ISO 19115-1:2014 Geographic information â€” Metadata](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) for latitude and longitude coordinates. The standard way of doing this is with [**regular expressions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). 
  * A data specification meant for just one project or infrastructure's workflows might allow a looser description of some kinds of datatype, for example allowing dates having different formats to be a datatype of "date", or numbers of different precisions to be a "numeric" type.  However, both data specifications and data standards ideally minimize such ambiguities, so that "04/05/11" doesn't get confused about month, day and year, or a "10.5" value doesn't throw an error because one database chose to store it as an integer, while another chose a decimal format.  Its best to be as precise and granular about desired datatypes up front, acknowledging however that characteristics can be measured in different ways (as noted in attributes section below).

Encountering a value that has a syntactic structure beyond random characters suggests that it has some meaning about something, which leads to the topic of attributes.

### Attributes
A kind of table record, spreadsheet, computational object or class, ontological entity, or user interface form may have some number of required and/or optional **attributes**.  Depending on use context, an attribute is also known as a **field, property, variable, characteristic or slot**.  An attribute specification should include a relatively plain language definition that distinguishes it from other attributes having similar names or semantics.  In the ontology section we discuss Aristotelean definitions that take advantage of attributes organized in semantic hierarchies.  In ontology speak, we would say abstractly that an attribute is a characteristic of an entity.

  * **Attribute naming**: When someone references an attribute there may be some ambiguity in what they mean - do they mean a column display name, a 3rd party standardized field name, or a programmatic name for use in scripts or databases?  A separation of concerns needs to be established in an attribute specification about its default plain name for display purposes (which typically appears in applications and user interfaces), its computational coding (database or programming) reference, and its standardized name or reference.
    * **Plain name**: A default plain language user interface **label or title** (including spreadsheet column labels) for human readability, such as "Birth Date", "Birthdate", "date of birth", "born", etc. Enabling the title or label to have language variants also paves the way for multilingual interfaces. In software it should not be used as the key for looking up attribute information.
    * **Coding name**: A computer software/script/analytic/database/serialization-level attribute "coding" name, such as "birth_date".  This name is the key to machine readability, and its standard format should align with popular programming variable naming conventions to avoid errors in parsing data files and validation, and to enable code generation (e.g. alphanumeric + underscore only; no spaces, dashes, slashes, brackets, parentheses or dots etc. allowed in a name).  Data schema frameworks like LinkML have been guided by [Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) / [R and SQL compatible](https://bookdown.org/content/d1e53ac9-28ce-472f-bc2c-f499f18264a3/names.html) attribute names, and standardized table / object names, in particular:
      
       * **PascalCase**: **for table, object and picklist names, use an alphanumeric string beginning with a capital letter.** A MS Excell regular expression
       * **lower_camel_case**: **for attribute coding names, use lowercase alphanumeric words separated by underscores.**

      For those working in MS Excell who need to obtain coding names automatically from some plain language names, a regular expression for converting a spreadsheet column A, row 1 plain attribute name
      - to PascalCase: **=regexreplace(proper(A1),"[_ (/)-]","")**
      - to lower_camel_case: **=Lower(regexreplace(regexreplace(A1,"[ /]","_"),"[-()]",""))**
  
    * **Standardized vocabulary term reference**: As detailed in the permanent identifiers section below, an attribute specification can have one or more purl identifiers which point to ontology or other structured vocabulary terms which indicate that the attribute is machine comparable with any similarly marked attribute. Each purl should point to a resource that indicates a term's semantic definition, synonymy and logical constraints. For example the Cell Ontology [cell type](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000000) purl can be the standardized reference for a "cell_type" attribute, and in fact that term's subordinate terms can be used as the list of possible values a cell_type attribute can hold.

### Attribute value(s)
An attribute's schema specification allows at least one value datatype but in some schemas it may have more than one, such as a "birthdate" attribute which can have both a date datatype value but also a "null value list" (a categorical picklist of missing, not collected, etc. data collection statuses).  Standards such as NCBI's [missing value reporting](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/biosample/submission-e.html#missing-value-reporting) cover this.  As well, some fields allow multi-select picklists, which have to be saved in delimited strings, or a 1-field-to-many-values data structure.

### Attribute semantics
An attribute has a narrower fundamental **datatype** which conveys the value syntax related to how it was measured, as well as a contextual **semantic type** that indicates what was being measured.  For example while an attribute might simply be called "age" (with datatype integer and implicit year unit), it is not intended to be compared with any dataset's "age" attribute out there in the world, as shown by this list of [age kinds](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001167).  An attribute plain text definition might state what particular kind of age it is or entity it applies to, but computers are blind to that.  This is why data schemas benefit from the addition of both datatype and standardized vocabulary references. Ideally a data schema draws upon a shared library of attributes organized by their semantic differentiae.
  
  * **Measures**: Attributes aren't always measured in the same way, even within the same schema, so in that case different attributes (with different coding and plain names) should be defined that include the precise unit measure or scale in question (such as "age_in_years" or "age_in_weeks" or "gestational_age" or "trimester_age"). This solves computational ambiguity.
  * **Categorical attributes**: As shows up often in surveys, some attributes are measured by categorical/ordinal set of permissable values (such as "young / adult / elderly" for age). These choices are coming from schema-imbedded picklists, or from one or more controlled vocabularies.  Data schemas need a mechanism to indicate what the vocabulary "picklist" choices are, or in the case of large and evolving vocabularies, where they are online, and which branches to include or exclude choices from.

### Compound attributes
These are object or data structure specifications made out of several attributes, so for example a "geo_location" attribute might be a combination of latitiude and longitude in one string, or if a given schema framework allows, a location can reference say a LatLong class of object which itself has two attributes, latitude and longitude.

Another example is the variety of address kinds (postal box, street, legal, head office, home) which could be serialized in a single string value. Generally schema designers prefer to split an address up into attributes of a general address object containing street or post office box, city, postal code, region etc. elements.
  
### Permanent identifiers
Given the need to reference vocabulary and other data resources on the web, standardization work often involves a kind of value called a **permanent identifier** reference that points to a resource like a dataset, document, or vocabulary term detail page.  For a web reference this is called a **permanent URL or "purl"**, such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001167](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001167).  Once a purl goes into circulation on the web, it is expected to remain there so it can always retrieve the resource, or, if what it points to becomes archaic or discontinued, a "deprecated" code response. Additionally, if a newer vocabulary or resource replaces it, a replacement identifier is indicated. This way data content can be updated to harmonize and simplify federation and querying.

There are registries of purl-endowed resources which include databases and ontologies, such as the W3C Permanent Identifier Community Group's [purl registry](https://w3id.org/), and [bioregistry.io](https://bioregistry.io/) which has more of a life science research focus and is an excellent place for projects to add their own resource links (when a vocabulary referenced in a database is not yet represented on the web).

## Structured vocabulary
We use the term "structured vocabulary" (also known as controlled vocabulary) to describe a file of vocabulary terms (such as a taxonomy or ontology) that includes attribute details to some extent - such as plain english or other language names, coding names, definitions, and semantics such as hierarchies of terms.  Agencies can build up a roster of recommended structured vocabularies for use in their project and infrastructure data schemas.  We are especially interested in structured vocabularies backed by multi-agency collaborative curation, and which have a purl for each term that can be found in searchable portals.  Leading examples of such vocabularies and search portals include:

  * The international CGIAR agricultural research agency has published a resource of common [Ontologies for agriculture](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/ontologies-for-agriculture/).
  * [AgroPortal](https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/) supported by a number of leading French research agencies is another source of agriculture research vocabulary.
  * [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) is a multi-agency collaborative effort of life science ontologies related to agriculture, biology, climate, and ecology research, all operating within an aligned curational methodology.
  * [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4) The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) European Bioinformatics Institute ontology search interface reflects the agencies commitment to supporting life science ontologies.
  * [Fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) has a standards registry dedicated to workflow and ontology resources.
  * [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/) has an extensive set of country, region, city/town, and other geolocation identifiers obtainable by searching for a desired name.
  * [GOLD](https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/ecosystem_classification) ecosystem classification system in flat [tabular format](https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/download?mode=ecosystempaths), and its OBO Foundry compatible [ontology equivalent](https://github.com/cmungall/gold-ontology/blob/main/gold_definitions.yaml).

## Sources of standardized attributes
Ontology terms might be precise in terms of describing a thing that is measured, but not how it is measured.  Data schema attributes often go further than ontologies in that attribute specifications include the datatype of value(s).  Standardized attributes with coding names are found in e.g. flat [NCBI BioSample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/packages/) repository standards and more structured [Phenopacket standards](https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/).  More details on using structured vocabulary including ontologies is provided in the [ontology](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/Data_Standardization/ontology.html) section.
