## Why standardize file names?

Standardizing file naming conventions helps researchers better organize their own work and collaborate with others. 
Benefits include: 
* Consistent structure across files, making it easier for researchers to locate and identify documents.
* Uniform file names make it easier to sort and arrange files in alphabetical or chronological order. 
* Promotes a shared understanding of how files are named and organized.
* version numbers or dates in file names helps manage version control effectively.
