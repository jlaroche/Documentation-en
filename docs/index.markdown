The free e-textbook [Research Data Management in the Canadian Context (2023)](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/canadardm/) is an excellent and comprehensive resource. 


## FAIR resources
* Free e-textbook [Research Data Management in the Canadian Context](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/canadardm/)
* Official [GO-FAIR website](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
* EOSC has released a [resource site](https://catalogue.fair-impact.eu/resources) to help find ways to implement FAIR principles.
* The [Digital Research Alliance of Canada has links to many training resources](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/research-data-management/learning-and-training/training-resources) which would be useful to researchers.
